What is it?
===========

The GNU Privacy Guard (gpg, or gpg.exe on Windows) is a command-line program
which provides support for programmatic access via spawning a separate process
to run it and then communicating with that process from your program.

This project, ``python-gnupg``, implements a Python library which takes care
of the internal details and allows its users to generate and manage keys,
encrypt and decrypt data, and sign and verify messages.

Installation
============

Installing from PyPI
--------------------

You can install this package from the Python Package Index (pyPI) by running::

    pip install python-gnupg

.. important::
   There is at least one fork of this project, which was apparently created
   because an earlier version of this software used the ``subprocess`` module
   with ``shell=True``, making it vulnerable to shell injection. **This is no
   longer the case**.

   Forks may not be drop-in compatible with this software, so take care to use
   the correct version, as indicated in the ``pip install`` command above.


Installing from a source distribution archive
---------------------------------------------
To install this package from a source distribution archive, do the following:

1. Extract all the files in the distribution archive to some directory on your
   system.
2. In that directory, run ``python setup.py install``.
3. Optionally, run ``python test_gnupg.py`` to ensure that the package is
   working as expected.

Credits
=======

* The developers of the GNU Privacy Guard.
* The original version of this module was developed by Andrew Kuchling.
* It was improved by Richard Jones.
* It was further improved by Steve Traugott.

The present incarnation, based on the earlier versions, uses the ``subprocess``
module and so works on Windows as well as Unix/Linux platforms. It's not,
however, 100% backwards-compatible with earlier incarnations.

Change log
==========

.. note:: GCnn refers to an issue nn on Google Code.


0.4.9 (future)
--------------

Released: Not yet.

* Fixed #161: Added a status attribute to the returned object from gen_key() which
  is set to 'ok' if a key was successfully created, or 'key not created' if that
  was reported by gpg, or None in any other case.

* Fixed #164: Provided the ability to add subkeys. Thanks to Daniel Kilimnik for the
  feature request and patch.

* Fixed #166: Added keygrip values to the information collected when keys are listed.
  Thanks to Daniel Kilimnik for the feature request and patch.


0.4.8
-----

Released: 2021-11-24

* Fixed #147: Return gpg's return code in all result instances.

* Fixed #152: Add check for invalid file objects.

* Fixed #157: Provide more useful status message when a secret key is absent.

* Fixed #158: Added a get_recipients() API to find the recipients of an encrypted
  message without decrypting it.


0.4.7
-----

Released: 2021-03-11

* Fixed #129, #141: Added support for no passphrase during key generation.

* Fixed #143: Improved permission-denied test. Thanks to Elliot Cameron for the patch.

* Fixed #144: Updated logging to only show partial results.

* Fixed #146: Allowed a passphrase to be passed to import_keys(). Thanks to Chris de
  Graaf for the patch.


0.4.6
-----

Released: 2020-04-17

* Fixed #122: Updated documentation about gnupghome needing to be an existing
  directory.

* Fixed #123: Handled error conditions from gpg when calling trust_keys().

* Fixed #124: Avoided an exception being raised when ImportResult.summary()
  was called after a failed recv_keys().

* Fixed #128: Added ECC support by changing key generation parameters. (The Key-Length
  value isn't added if a curve is specified.)

* Fixed #130: Provided a mechanism to provide more complete error messages.

Support for Python versions 3.5 and under is discontinued, except for Python 2.7.


0.4.5
-----

Released: 2019-08-12

* Fixed #107: Improved documentation.

* Fixed #112: Raised a ValueError if a gnupghome is specified which is not an
  existing directory.

* Fixed #113: Corrected stale link in the documentation.

* Fixed #116: Updated documentation to clarify when spurious key-expired/
  signature-expired messages might be seen.

* Fixed #119: Added --yes to avoid pinentry when deleting secret keys with
  GnuPG >= 2.1.

* A warning is logged if gpg returns a non-zero return code.

* Added ``extra_args`` to ``import_keys``.

* Added support for CI using AppVeyor.


0.4.4
-----

Released: 2019-01-24

* Fixed #108: Changed how any return value from the ``on_data`` callable is
  processed. In earlier versions, the return value was ignored. In this version,
  if the return value is ``False``, the data received from ``gpg`` is not
  buffered. Otherwise (if the value is ``None`` or ``True``, for example), the
  data is buffered as normal. This functionality can be used to do your own
  buffering, or to prevent buffering altogether.

  The ``on_data`` callable is also called once with an empty byte-string to
  signal the end of data from ``gpg``.

* Fixed #97: Added an additional attribute ``check_fingerprint_collisions`` to
  ``GPG`` instances, which defaults to ``False``. It seems that ``gpg`` is happy
  to have duplicate keys and fingerprints in a keyring, so we can't be too
  strict. A user can set this attribute of an instance to ``True`` to trigger a
  check for collisions.

* Fixed #111: With GnuPG 2.2.7 or later, provide the fingerprint of a signing
  key for a failed signature verification, if available.

* Fixed #21: For verification where multiple signatures are involved, a
  mapping of signature_ids to fingerprint, keyid, username, creation date,
  creation timestamp and expiry timestamp is provided.

* Added a check to disallow certain control characters ('\r', '\n', NUL) in
  passphrases.


0.4.3
-----

Released: 2018-06-13

* Added --no-verbose to the gpg command line, in case verbose is specified in
  gpg.conf - we don't need verbose output.


0.4.2
-----

Released: 2018-03-28

* Fixed #81: Subkey information is now collected and returned in a ``subkey_info``
  dictionary keyed by the subkey's ID.

* Fixed #84: GPG2 version is now correctly detected on OS X.

* Fixed #94: Added ``expect_passphrase`` password for use on GnuPG >= 2.1 when
  passing passphrase to ``gpg`` via pinentry.

* Fixed #95: Provided a ``trust_keys`` method to allow setting the trust level
  for keys. Thanks to William Foster for a suggested implementation.

* Made the exception message when the gpg executable is not found contain the
  path of the executable that was tried. Thanks to Kostis Anagnostopoulos for
  the suggestion.

* Fixed #100: Made the error message less categorical in the case of a failure
  with an unspecified reason, adding some information from gpg error codes when
  available.


0.4.1
-----

Released: 2017-07-06

* Updated message handling logic to no longer raise exceptions when a message
  isn't recognised. Thanks to Daniel Kahn Gillmor for the patch.

* Always use always use ``--fixed-list-mode``, ``--batch`` and
  ``--with-colons``. Thanks to Daniel Kahn Gillmor for the patch.

* Improved ``scan_keys()`` handling on GnuPG >= 2.1. Thanks to Daniel Kahn
  Gillmor for the patch.

* Improved test behaviour with GnuPG >= 2.1. Failures when deleting test
  directory trees are now ignored. Thanks to Daniel Kahn Gillmor for the patch.

* Added ``close_file`` keyword argument to verify_file to allow the file closing
  to be made optional. Current behaviour is maintained - ``close_file=False``
  can be passed to skip closing the file being verified.

* Added the ``extra_args`` keyword parameter to allow custom arguments to be
  passed to the ``gpg`` executable.

* Instances of the ``GPG`` class now have an additional ``on_data`` attribute,
  which defaults to ``None``. It can be set to a callable which will be called
  with a single argument - a binary chunk of data received from the ``gpg``
  executable. The callable can do whatever it likes with the chunks passed to it
  - e.g. write them to a separate stream. The callable should not raise any
  exceptions (unless it wants the current operation to fail).


0.4.0
-----

Released: 2017-01-29

* Added support for ``KEY_CONSIDERED`` in more places - encryption /
  decryption, signing, key generation and key import.

* Partial fix for #32 (GPG 2.1 compatibility). Unfortunately, better
  support cannot be provided at this point, unless there are certain
  changes (relating to pinentry popups) in how GPG 2.1 works.

* Fixed #60: An IndexError was being thrown by ``scan_keys()``.

* Ensured that utf-8 encoding is used when the ``--with-column`` mode is
  used. Thanks to Yann Leboulanger for the patch.

* ``list_keys()`` now uses ``--fixed-list-mode``. Thanks to Werner Koch
  for the pointer.


0.3.9
-----

Released: 2016-09-10

* Fixed #38: You can now request information about signatures against
  keys. Thanks to SunDwarf for the suggestion and patch, which was used
  as a basis for this change.

* Fixed #49: When exporting keys, no attempt is made to decode the output when
  armor=False is specified.

* Fixed #53: A ``FAILURE`` message caused by passing an incorrect passphrase
  is handled.

* Handled ``EXPORTED`` and ``EXPORT_RES`` messages while exporting keys. Thanks
  to Marcel Pörner for the patch.

* Fixed #54: Improved error message shown when gpg is not available.

* Fixed #55: Added support for ``KEY_CONSIDERED`` while verifying.

* Avoided encoding problems with filenames under Windows. Thanks to Kévin
  Bernard-Allies for the patch.

* Fixed #57: Used a better mechanism for comparing keys.


0.3.8
-----

Released: 2015-09-24

* Fixed #22: handled ``PROGRESS`` messages during verification and signing.

* Fixed #26: handled ``PINENTRY_LAUNCHED`` messages during verification,
  decryption and key generation.

* Fixed #28: Allowed a default Name-Email to be computed even when neither of
  ``LOGNAME`` and ``USERNAME`` are in the environment.

* Fixed #29: Included test files missing from the tarball in previous versions.

* Fixed #39: On Python 3.x, passing a text instead of a binary stream caused
  file decryption to hang due to a ``UnicodeDecodeError``. This has now been
  correctly handled: The decryption fails with a "no data" status.

* Fixed #41: Handled Unicode filenames correctly by encoding them on 2.x using
  the file system encoding.

* Fixed #43: handled ``PINENTRY_LAUNCHED`` messages during key export. Thanks
  to Ian Denhardt for looking into this.

* Hide the console window which appears on Windows when gpg is spawned.
  Thanks to Kévin Bernard-Allies for the patch.

* Subkey fingerprints are now captured.

* The returned value from the ``list_keys`` method now has a new attribute,
  ``key_map``, which is a dictionary mapping key and subkey fingerprints to
  the corresponding key's dictionary. With this change, you don't need to
  iterate over the (potentially large) returned list to search for a key with
  a given fingerprint - the ``key_map`` dict will take you straight to the key
  info, whether the fingerprint you have is for a key or a subkey. Thanks to
  Nick Daly for the initial suggestion.

0.3.7
-----

Released: 2014-12-07

Signed with PGP key: Vinay Sajip (CODE SIGNING KEY) <vinay_sajip@yahoo.co.uk>

Key Fingerprint    : CA74 9061 914E AC13 8E66 EADB 9147 B477 339A 9B86

* Added an ``output`` keyword parameter to the ``sign`` and
  ``sign_file`` methods, to allow writing the signature to a file.
  Thanks to Jannis Leidel for the patch.

* Allowed specifying ``True`` for the ``sign`` keyword parameter,
  which allows use of the default key for signing and avoids having to
  specify a key id when it's desired to use the default. Thanks to
  Fabian Beutel for the patch.

* Used a uniform approach with subprocess on Windows and POSIX: shell=True
  is not used on either.

* When signing/verifying, the status is updated to reflect any expired or
  revoked keys or signatures.

* Handled 'NOTATION_NAME' and 'NOTATION_DATA' during verification.

* Fixed #1, #16, #18, #20: Quoting approach changed, since now shell=False.

* Fixed #14: Handled 'NEED_PASSPHRASE_PIN' message.

* Fixed #8: Added a scan_keys method to allow scanning of keys without the
  need to import into a keyring. Thanks to Venzen Khaosan for the suggestion.

* Fixed #5: Added '0x' prefix when searching for keys. Thanks to Aaron Toponce
  for the report.

* Fixed #4: Handled 'PROGRESS' message during encryption. Thanks to Daniel
  Mills for the report.

* Fixed #3: Changed default encoding to Latin-1.

* Fixed #2: Raised ValueError if no recipients were specified
  for an asymmetric encryption request.

* Handled 'UNEXPECTED' message during verification. Thanks to
  David Andersen for the patch.

* Replaced old range(len(X)) idiom with enumerate().

* Refactored ``ListKeys`` / ``SearchKeys`` classes to maximise use of common
  functions.

* Fixed GC94: Added ``export-minimal`` and ``armor`` options when exporting
  keys. This addition was inadvertently left out of 0.3.6.
